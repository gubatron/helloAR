# HelloAR

Simple AR app that places objects in the real world given a pre-configured set of GPS locations in the real world.
The app is supposed to use location services on the phone and the ARCore kit to render these 3D objects in space.
It's an exercise to familiarize myself with the AR apis and what they can do.

It couldn't have been done without chatGPT+ (GPT4, May 24 version)
